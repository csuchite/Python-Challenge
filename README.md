I am analyzing financial records of a company. I will be looking at profits and losses the company had over an entire period. This will included dates and amounts.

I will be helping a small rural town to modernize the vote counting process. I will analyze voter ID, county, and candidate and deliver an efficient and simple way for the voters to make their vote.
